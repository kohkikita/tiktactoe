# 🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe (Python, OOP)

A simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python and object-oriented programming principles.

---

## 📦 Features

- Two-player mode
- Input validation
- Win and tie detection
- Clean object-oriented structure:
  - `Board` class
  - `Player` class
  - `Game` class

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kohkikita/tiktactoe.git
cd tiktactoe
```

### 2. Run the game

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure you're using Python 3.7 or higher.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Players enter their names and unique single-character symbols.
- The game loop alternates turns between players.
- The board checks for wins (rows, columns, diagonals) and detects ties.
- Input is validated for range and availability.
